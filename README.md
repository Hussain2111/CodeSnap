Every CS student wastes time frantically typing code from the professor's screen during lectures. You miss explanations because you're focused on typing. You make typos. The professor moves to the next slide before you finish. You ask them to slow down or go back. Or worse - you take a blurry photo and try to manually retype it later. It's inefficient and breaks the flow of learning.
The Solution (1 para):
CodeSnap lets students snap a photo of the projected code with their phone, and instantly get clean, copy-pasteable code on their device. Take a picture → Gemini Vision extracts the code → Formatted code appears in your web app → Copy to your IDE in one click. No more frantic typing, no more typos, no more asking professors to wait. Students can focus on understanding instead of transcribing.
